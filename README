Automatic pair character completion plugin for gedit
====================================================

Automatically closes brackets and quotes.

Installation
------------

1. Run the install.sh script. 

2. Restart gedit if it is already started.

3. Select Edit->Preferences from the menu. Click on the Plugins tab and enable 
   the "Pair Character Completion" plugin.

Usage
-----
  
Automatically inserts a closing parenthesis ) whenever an opening parenthesis ( 
is typed. The default paired characters are (), [], {}, "", '', and ``. The 
plugin is smart enough to automatically overwrite existing closing brackets 
when appropriate.

Selecting a block of text and typing an opening parenthesis or quote character 
will enclose the selection in quotes or parenthesis.

To quickly jump out of nested quotes or brackets and start a newline, type 
Ctrl+Return. To jump to the end of the line, insert a semicolon, and start a 
newline, type Ctrl+Shift+Return. 

Custom sets of per-language pair chars are supported. To change the default 
pair chars or add support for new languages, edit the file pair_char_lang.py.

Notes
-----

* The default pair characters are: {},(),[],"",'',``
* The default statement terminator is ';'

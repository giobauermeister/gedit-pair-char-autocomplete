Installation
------------

2. Restart gedit if it is already started.

3. Select Edit->Preferences from the menu. Click on the Plugins tab and enable 
   the "Pair Character Completion" plugin.


Usage
-----
  
When the plugin is enabled typing an open parenthesis, bracket, brace, or quote 
character will automatically the corresponding character. For example if you 
type a '[' character, a ']' will be automatically inserted. The plugin is smart 
enough to automatically overwrite existing closing brackets when it is 
appropriate.

If you want to enclose a block of text in brackets or quotes, select the text 
you wish to enclose, and type the opening bracket or quote character.

To quickly jump out of nested quotes or brackets and start a newline, type 
Ctrl+Return. If you want to insert a semi-colon at the end of the line, type 
Ctrl+Shift+Return.

Notes
-----

* The default pair characters are: {},(),[],"",'',``
* The default statement terminator is ';'
